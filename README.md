# Comparison-of-Different-Face-Detection-algorithm
in this project i have done face detection using 3 different algorithms namely: 1) Haar Cascade Classifier 2)LBP Cascade Classifier 3) Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) in Dlib
 I have calculated the time taken by each algorithm to show a comparison between them.
